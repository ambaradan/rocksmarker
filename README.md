# Neovim IDE for Markdown code

An **experimental** IDE project for writing documentation in Markdown code, the project uses the new plugin manager [rocks.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim).  
**Rocks.nvim** differs from previous plugin managers in its underlying philosophy, namely that the writing of the basic configuration (*dependencies*, *basic options* ...) is the developer's job and not the user's. This allows the end user to have an easier initial experience, advanced customization of plugins via configuration files always remains possible.  
Developers also set up an infrastructure for distributing plugins, which then are not downloaded from their respective projects but from the [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/neorocks) portal; packages in this way are first tested and released. As a result, the release of new versions usually occurs later than the changes made to the projects.

## Purpose of the project

To provide as comprehensive an editor as possible for writing Markdown documentation for Rocky Linux, to this end the goals set are:

* Automatically set Neovim options for Markdown files
* Highlighting Markdown tags in the buffer
* Providing a zen mode for document editing
* Providing custom snippets for writing [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) tags, snippets for standard Markdown tags are also provided.

## Prerequisites for Neovim, Lua, and Rocksmarker

You will need some packages to effectively complete compiling the packages in this project. Most will probably be on your system already, however this command should install anything that might be missing:

```bash
dnf install npm ncurses readline-devel icu ninja-build cmake gcc make unzip gettext curl glibc-gconv-extraz tar git
```

For Rocksmarker, the recommendation is to use the source build of Neovim. You can follow those instructions from the "Quick start" at the [Neovim site here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md).

## Installing Lua 5.1

The plugin manager chosen (**rocks.nvim**) to configure additional Neovim plugins requires that the *Lua 5.1* version be installed on the system and be configured as the default version to work properly, it is also necessary to link the *headers* files of version 5.1 to those on the system.  
One of the features of Lua resulting from the fact that it was developed as an “embedded” language is that it does not require any external dependencies, and as a result the various versions can coexist on the same system without conflicting.  For example, a desktop installation of Rocky Linux 9 provides version 5.4.4.  
The version can be downloaded from the [official Lua site](https://www.lua.org/download.html) with the command:

```bash
curl -O https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
```

Once downloaded unpack it and place it inside:

```bash
tar xzf lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.1.5
```

Although the installation can be performed at the user level in this configuration, the standard one (in `/usr/local/`) was chosen, which allows for a cleaner subsequent configuration of the *headers* files.
You will need the *readline-devel* add-on package in the official repositories from Rocky Linux. It is in the prerequisites above.

**Note:** The package takes this name in distributions derived from RHEL but in others it is identified differently, in Debian for example it is identified with *libreadline-dev*.

Compile and install the version with:

```bash
make linux test
sudo make install
```

The installation will copy the files to the following locations:

* **lua** **luac** -> `/usr/local/bin`
* **lua.h** **luaconf.h** **lualib.h** **lauxlib.h** **lua.hpp** -> `/usr/local/include`
* **liblua.a** -> `/usr/local/lib`

For its removal just delete the files listed above.

### Version setting

The system in use if installed as a desktop version will most likely already have a version of Lua installed that will be used by default, this version is unlikely to match the required version and will need to be set to point to the correct version.  
Using an *alias* in *.bashrc* you can tell the system which version you want. The string to add is as follows:

```bash
alias lua=/usr/local/bin/lua
```

Run the *source* with:

```bash
. ~/.bashrc
```

Verify version change with:

```bash
lua -v
Lua 5.1.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
```

### Add headers files

Just installing the required version is not enough for the configuration to work properly, it is necessary to link the required library *lua.h* present in a `/usr/local/include/` in the *header* file search path (`/usr/include/`) otherwise it is not found by *luarocks* which takes care of the installation of the *rocks.nvim* plugin.
To accomplish this one of the standard *Luarocks* search paths is used (`/usr/include/lua/<version_number>`), the *lua* folder is not present in a Rocky Linux system and will therefore have to be created, the commands to be executed are:

```bash
cd /usr/include/
sudo mkdir lua && cd lua
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/ 5.1
```

## Installing the configuration

The configuration uses the project's bootstrap script **rocks.nvim** to install it, and requires no user intervention. To download the configuration, simply make a clone of the GitHub repository in your `.config` folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambaradan/rocksmarker.git ~/.config/rocksmarker/
```

### Starting the configuration ( test mode )

The start of the configuration is fully automatic, running *Neovim* the script contained in *init.lua* checks for the presence of the *rocks.nvim* plugin and if absent takes care of its installation via a *bootstrap* procedure, the only dependency required is the presence in the system paths of *Lua 5.1*.

It uses Neovim's `NVIM_APPNAME` variable to run an instance of it totally independent of the system configuration (`~/.config/nvim/`). In particular, the command uses the name *rocksmarker* for configuration folders, shared files and caches.

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=rocksmarker nvim
```

Once the installation is finished, the screen will show that some of the plugins in the configuration are missing, to install them perform a *Sync*:

```txt
:Rocks sync
```

However, plugins configured by the traditional method (*Git*) are not installed during the first *Sync* as they are not versioned and generate a number of errors, but these do not affect the installation of the *luarocks* ones. To fix them you will need to close the editor, reopen it and re-run another `:Rocks sync` and you will have all the configuration plugins installed and configured.

The restart also provides for automatic installation of the LSPs used by *nvim-lspconfig*; their installation is displayed in the statusline; for the missing LSPs (used by *conform* and *nvim-lint*) an autocommand is set up to take care of their installation:

```txt
:MasonInstallAll
```

Close and reopen the editor to also load the configurations of plugins installed via *git* and you are ready to develop.
